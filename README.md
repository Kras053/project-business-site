# Business Site

A business site containing a hero video header, a form and an accordion. 

## The problem

I struggled, among other things, with positioning in the desktop mode trying to place the img, form and accordion next to each other with the same distance between them. 
Also with the div container since the form and the accordion adapts to the other ones size, so for instance when the accordion expands the form stretches out aswell.  
If I had more time I would fix this and also add more JavaScript such as transition effect on the accordion and also symbols + and - for expanding and minimizing.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
