# Business Site

A business site containing a hero video header, a form and an accordion. 

## The problem
If I had more time I would dive more into the struggle with positioning in the desktop mode trying to place the img, form and accordion next to each other with the same gap distance between them. 
Also I would try to see why the form and the accordion adapts to the other ones size, so for instance when the accordion expands the form also stretches out.  
I'd also add more JavaScript such as transition effect on the accordion and also symbols + and - for expanding and minimizing.
