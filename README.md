# Business Site

A business site containing a hero video header, a form and an accordion. 

## The problem
The accordion is expanded when the page open, so if I had more time I would fix it.
I also struggled with positioning in the desktop mode trying to place the img, form and accordion next to each other with the same distance between them. 
Also with the div container since the form and the accordion adapts to the other ones size, so for instance when the accordion expands the form stretches out aswell.  
I'd also add more JavaScript such as transition effect on the accordion and also symbols + and - for expanding and minimizing.
